## Need to Improve
* Need to improve CSS
* Consistency between the different teams, such as how styling is applied and structure of html: it clearly looks like different developers worked on different files
* When the user edits a recipe from the view page and save, it should go back to the view page, not the homepage
* Define the definition of 'Done'
* Have more unit testing
* Communication between different teams
* Improve buggy code in view page
* Styling issues such as font sizes (when to use relative vs absolute sizing)
* Making JS code conform to SRP

## Define the Definition of Done
* Pass CI pipline
* Write with comments
* The source files' names should be consistent
* The user can use it smoothly without encountering any bugs or major design issues
* The app should loop as pretty and consistent (between pages) as possible
* Code approved by a thorough PR
* Checked for sufficient abstraction / following SRP
* Pass the UI tests
* Checks all the boxes/requirements set on sprint board and issues connected to that task
* Complies with style guidelines

## Decisions Made During the Meeting
* Decide a time to meet again this Friday at 11 am
