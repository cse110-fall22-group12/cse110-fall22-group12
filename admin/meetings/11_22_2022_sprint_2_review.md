## Need to Improve

- Need to improve CSS
- Consistency between the different teams, such as how styling is applied and structure of html: it clearly looks like different developers worked on different files
- When the user edits a recipe from the view page and save, it should go back to the view page, not the homepage
- Define the definition of 'Done'
- Have more unit testing
- Communication between different teams
- Improve buggy code in view page
- Styling issues such as font sizes (when to use relative vs absolute sizing)
- Making JS code conform to SRP

## Define the Definition of Done

- Pass CI pipline
- Write with comments
- The source files' names should be consistent
- The user can use it smoothly without encountering any bugs or major design issues
- The app should loop as pretty and consistent (between pages) as possible
- Code approved by a thorough PR
- Checked for sufficient abstraction / following SRP
- Pass the UI tests
- Checks all the boxes/requirements set on sprint board and issues connected to that task
- Complies with style guidelines
