## Completed Tasks

- Set up Noshroom Development rules
  - Global Rules:
    - Use 2 spaces for indentation.
    - Use uncapitalized words for the name of files, class names, identifiers, and add dashes for spaces (avoid having too many words for a name if possible, one or two at best).
    - For all the identifiers and class names, add the name of your page before it and connect them with a dash.
      - Example: “home-title-label”, “view-edit-button”, “global-icon”, etc.
  - HTML Rules:
    - Use double quotes.
    - Use correct indentation.
    - Put the link to the google font before including other CSS files.
    - Follow the foundation code for creating the top bar, stage elements, and alert box.
    - Delete all the instruction documentations that guide developers to use the foundation code.
    - Only write documentations if the following HTML code is very hard to understand and also remember to put an empty line before the comment.
    - Minimize id’s and classes as much as possible
    - Use descriptive tags.
    - Remove all the testing code before committing the final version.
  - CSS Rules:
    - Use double quotes.
    - Write documentation using /\* \*/ before every CSS block and add an empty line before it.
    - Write documentation using /\* \*/ at the end of a line to explain it if the line is very confusing.
    - Try to use less identifiers and class names in the CSS files, which requires a redesign of the HTML code.
  - JavaScript Rules:
    - Use snake_case for variable names.
    - Use single quotes.
    - Use /\*\* \*/ to document a function before it.
    - Use only @param and @return when the function has parameters or a return value.
    - Use the format: @param {type} name description
    - Indent the name and description so that they are horizontally aligned.
    - Use // to do inline documentations inside functions.
    - Use // to document a block if it is doing something different than the code above.
    - The // documentation begins with an uncapitalized word and ends with a period or a colon.
    - Use /_ global _/ to specify the functions you are using in other files.
    - Add an empty line between every two functions.
    - Add an empty line before // inline documentations.
    - Document every function in the following way:
    - Add 1 empty line at the end of a file.
    - Declare the variable of the element before performing operations (adding event listeners) to it.
    - If a line is too long and Prettier breaks it into multiple lines with terrible indentations, then try to break it using variables.
    - One function per job. Split it when necessary.
  - Commit Message Rules:
    - Start a capitalized verb in the present tense and end with a period.
    - Describe the changes compared to the previous version.
    - Also mention the files you have edit (or at least describe the properties of the files).
    - Examples:
      - Good: Fix the bug in the edit.html so the home button directs back to the home page.
      - Good: Update readme.md to fix a grammar issue.
      - Bad: fix the bug!!!
      - Bad: I hate this!
