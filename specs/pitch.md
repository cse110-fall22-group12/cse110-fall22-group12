# Noshroom Pitch
## Risks

## Rabbit holes
- We never wrapped a web app to a phone app before
- Make all the pictures fit the same rounded rectangle is hard
- Allow user to upload image could be a problem
- Store data in local storage and fetch it later could be hard to do
- We cut the custom tag function since that is beyoned out ability and cost too much time
