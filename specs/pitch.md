# Noshroom Pitch

## Background



## What problem are we trying to solve
- Simplify all the redundant features that users encounter while using the applications online
- No involved tutorial is required for the user to understand the functionality of the product
- Provide a clean local product that enables users to manage their receipes without effort

## Statement of purpose
The purpose of the project is to create a flexible personal record local application for people who enjoy cooking to create and manage their own receipes, so that the users could manage their receipes easily locally.
- We want to addres the users' need for a more effective management system of receipes.
- We want to make sure the features of our app directly hit the core need of our user group.
- We want to create a local personal record for users to play with their receipes.
- We want to allow the users to navigate easily through different sections/tabs of the APP.
- We want to make the user experience as smooth as possible.

## User personas
### Persona 1 - Thomaas Poweell, 50
He is a chief at a French restaurant and he also enjoys cooking a lot at home. He always aim to improve his receipes so quite often he makes experiments about the ingredients use or make modification to the steps. He doesn't really enjoy using technologies that are too complicated. He just prefer simple things that cut to the point.  <br>

__Wants & Needs__
- Modify the receipes that he previously created
- Manage his list of receipes

__Frustration__
- Don't want to interact with complicated apps, would like to keep everything simple
- Don't want to experience difficulty/trouble while changing ingredients or steps in his receipe




### Persona 2 - Alice Brooks, 27
She is a mother of three children. She thinks food outside does not contain the necessary nutritions for the kids so she cooks for her kids all the time. Kids could be picky about food and she finds it difficult to decide what to cook for her kids sometimes.<br>

__Wants & Needs__
- Record all the receipes that she has previously used
- Choose from different receipe options

__Frustration__
- Don't want to spend much energy in finding her receipes among many others' - she's confident about her own receipes
- Don't want to navigate through complicated things, just want to manage her own receipes.


## Risks
- Try to maximize the number of features of the app within a very limited amount of time
- Some features require us to have advanced knowledge in certain tools, and learning a new tool takes time
- The unit-testing process of the project could be involved
- Ignore people's factors, e.g. people's ability to contribute as expected.

## Rabbit holes
- We never wrapped a web app to a phone app before
- Make all the pictures fit the same rounded rectangle is hard
- Allow user to upload image could be a problem
- Store data in local storage and fetch it later could be hard to do
- We cut the custom tag function since that is beyoned out ability and cost too much time
