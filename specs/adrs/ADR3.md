# Decision to focus on a recipe app

## Context and Problem Statements

- We needed to narrow the goal of our app since "food" is too wide of a user-set.
- Who are the consumers that we want to target?
- Who and why would people want to use a food-related app?

## Considered Options

- Recipe app focused on logging recipes
- Restaurant app focused on rating restaurant dishes
- Combination of recipes and restaurant dishes
- Calorie tracker

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Recide app focused on logging recipes", because we wanted to scale down our focus and target people who cook at home and want to note down
their favorite recipes. We want to allow users to add images, a text box for ingredients, and another text box for recipe steps. The other options can be
added later if time permits.
