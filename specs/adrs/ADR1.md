# Decide on a Diary Type of App #

## Problem ##
Our app is a 'local first' type of application. Therefore we want to store our user inforamtion on the local device with the option of uploading to the internet or somewhere else. 

## Considered Options ##
- big data type app that gives you statistics on daily choices: outfits
- calendar/diary entry where you log information wrt the date: mood tracker
- app where you log and detail different things at your own pace: foods eaten

## Decision Outcome ##
The simplest way to make something useful out of this concept is to have some type of logging application that does not hold a concept of time. It simply has CRUD operations and the user can log these entries.
