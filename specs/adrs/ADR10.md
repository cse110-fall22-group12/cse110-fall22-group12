# Include more features on the final website?

## Problem ##
We had the serach and custom tag functions written by some teammates. Should we include these advanced functionality to our website to
improve its quality?

* How do we make sure adding the new function will not mess up existing functions?
* How do we add new design for the search bar and tags based on the existing design?
* How do we make sure extra testing could be done before the deadline?

## Considered Options ##
* people vote, if vote yes will spend extra time on Saturday to add the functionality to the website
* we give up implementing new functions, instead we focus on testing and optimizing existing code
* we include the new functionality but we don't care about testing

## Decision Outcome ##
We decided that we would give up including more features on the final website. If we chose to include more features, we would run the
risk of crashing our existing functionality of our website. We would also need to spend extra time to write more test cases. As it is 
nearly the final week and some teammates are feeling sick and couldn't contribute, we will have limited people to work on testing. 
After the above consideration, we believe that it is not safe to add more functions as this point.
