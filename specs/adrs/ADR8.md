# Build Unit testing and end-2-end testings

## Problem ##
We have almost finished all the functionality of our project at this point. However, even though our project works fine while using manual testing, we are missing unit testing and UI testing.

* How do we make sure all functions used in our website are behaving as expected?
* How do we test different componenets of the website?
* How do we test the complete website?

## Considered Options ##
* each development code each page's tests
* each person contribute to the unit testing on his/her own
* mob programming to get started on the end-2-end testing

## Decision Outcome ##
We decided that we would have Elliot mainly worked on the unit-testing, and do mob programming using live share on vsCode to figure out how to get started on the end-2-end testing. A meeting will be held so everyone can contribute to the end-2-end testing process
