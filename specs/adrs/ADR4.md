# Decide on the Feature-Set of our Application #

## Problem ##

An app that manages logging a user's Recipes can have many features. We want to have a minimum viable product that can handle our targeted user's needs without overloading on features and the scope of our idea. This is because we have very little time to implement this project. 

* What features contribute to the UX of someone who likes to cook?
* How complicated are these features?
* Which features can be exclued for the MVP?

## Considered Options ##

### Features we need to have ###

* Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality

### Features we should have ###

* Ingredient List
* Steps List
* Recipe Name

### Features that would be nice to have ###

* Image of the food
* Rating of the food
* Multiple images per food.
* Sorting the recipes (by name/date/rating)
* Tagging the recipes with user made custom tags
* Searching through foods by name/tag

### Features that we should not have ###

* Multiple text boxes/entries for an ingredient section

## Decided Outcome ##

We decided on including the ability to create, update, read and delete recipe objects. Creating a recipe involves filling out a separate form page of a main image, a text entry of ingredients, and a text entry of steps. This page will also contain the ability to fill itself out with existing information to edit the recipe. We will not include multiple images, rating recipes, the search functionality, tagging options, or sorting functions.
