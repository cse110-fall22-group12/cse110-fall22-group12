# Improve transition between pages

## Problem ##
We have multiple pages on our website, however, the transition is not so smoonth for user experience.

* How do we improve user experience while they interact with the website?
* How do we do minimum coding to improve the transition, while maintaining the functionality of the website?

## Considered Options ##
* modify button effects
* add page transition effects

## Decision Outcome ##
We decided on adding better transition to our page. This is because we believe that this not only improves the quality of our product. 
Meanwhile, it requires minimum coding. What's more important, adding this transition will not interfere the normal functions of our code. 
Even though adding transition seems like adding a new feature, in fact, it is simply an improvement on the website without the need for 
extra testing. Due to the limited time we have right now, this is a perfect option to improve our product even furthuer. This effect
will be implemented by Zheyuan.
